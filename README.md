# Foxis

Foxis is a lightweight css framework that offers a lot of customization and flexibility through yaml. It's a standalone tool, but you're welcome to create any build tools for it.

i originally designed it because I found myself writing a lot of repetitive skeleton css code so i created it as a ready solution
